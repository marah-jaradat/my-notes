## My notes regarding JS course

### **Introduction about me:-**

My name is **Marah Jaradat**, Iam a civil engineer, after graduation i have found my passion in programming, i have started with the basics of this world, and i will keep going until become professional.

### **What I have learned about a good developer mindset:-**

To avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software.
**The key points that every developer must master:-**

1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software;  
*Remember*: the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are.

2. The Goals of Software Design;  
 To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be —and continue to be— as helpful as possible.

3. (Mis)understanding;  
**Understanding** is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.

4. Simplicity;  

   * Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.  
   * Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.

5. Complexity;  
   Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.

6. Maintenance;  
    The one rule that you should follow about maintenance is:
    *It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.*

7. Consistency;  
    In any team sport, the best teams have consistency and chemistry.

8. Prioritizing;  
    The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change.

9. Solving Problems;  
    If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.

10. Good enough is fine
    Perfect is the enemy of good.

11. Predictions;  
    Is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future. It could be factual and based on some kind of objective data or it could be based on an assumption.”

12. Assumptions;  
    An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof.
    *Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.*

13. Stop Reinventing  

14. Resistance  

15. Automation  
16. Code measurement;  
    you can't measure measure the software quality based on code lines; more code lines doesn't mean that perfect program.

17. Productivity;
    ne of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.”

18. Testing

19. (Under)Estimation  
    Remember:
    **Everything takes longer than you think.**

20. Running Away From Rewriting;  
    Refactoring should be the first option.

21. Documentation and Commenting;  
    The real purpose of comments is to explain *“WHY”* you did something, not *“WHAT”* the code is doing. If you don’t explain this, other programmers may be confused and when they go to change your code they might remove important parts of it.

22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)  

23. Self-Development  

24. Don’t be a hero  
Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
