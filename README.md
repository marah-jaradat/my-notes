## My notes regarding JS course

#### Introduction about me:-

My name is **Marah Jaradat**, Iam a civil engineer, after graduation i have found my passion in programming, i have started with the basics of this world, and i will keep going until become professional.

#### What I have learned about a good developer mindset:-

To avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software.
**The key points that every developer must master:-**

1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software;  
*Remember*: the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity

2. The Goals of Software Design;  
 To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as helpful as possible. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity

3. (Mis)understanding;  
**Understanding** is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity

4. Simplicity;  

>- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci  
>- Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does. — Larry Bossidy

5. Complexity;  
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. — Brian Kernighan

6. Maintenance;  
The one rule that you should follow about maintenance is:
*It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.*

7. Consistency;  
In any team sport, the best teams have consistency and chemistry. — Roger Staubach

8. Prioritizing;  
The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change. – Code Simplicity

9. Solving Problems;  
If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. — Richard Feynman

10. Good enough is fine; 
“Perfect is the enemy of good.” — Voltaire

11. Predictions;  
 is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future. It could be factual and based on some kind of objective data or it could be based on an assumption.”

12. Assumptions;  
An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof.
*Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. —  Code Simplicity*

13. Stop Reinventing  

14. Resistance  

15. Automation  

16. Code measurement;  
you can't measure measure the software quality based on code lines; more code lines doesn't mean that perfect program.

17. Productivity; 
One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.” — Ken Thompson

18. Testing 

19. (Under)Estimation  
Remember:
**Everything takes longer than you think.**

20. Running Away From Rewriting;  
Refactoring should be the first option.

21. Documentation and Commenting;  
The real purpose of comments is to explain *“WHY”* you did something, not *“WHAT”* the code is doing. If you don’t explain this, other programmers may be confused and when they go to change your code they might remove important parts of it. – Code Simplicity

22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)  

23. Self-Development  

24. Don’t be a hero  
Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
